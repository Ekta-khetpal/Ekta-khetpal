## Hi,I'm Ekta Khetpal ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer System Engineering student at DUET with a strong curiosity for how technology works from the inside out. I enjoy exploring programming, and development, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn new tools and concepts that can help me grow as a developer. Beyond coding, I believe in collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous learning â€” values that keep me motivated to contribute, improve, and innovate every day. ðŸš€

**ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on** improving my coding skills through small projects and problem-solving challenges  

**ðŸŒ± currently learning** Web Development and strengthening my foundations in C++  

**ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** beginner-friendly open-source projects and student coding communities  

**ðŸ“« Contact me:** 
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, share ideas, or just say hi!

**ðŸ’¡ Motivational Quote**

"The expert in anything was once a beginner."
â€“ Helen Hayes

**âš¡ Fun fact:** 
I love turning â˜• coffee into code and experimenting with new tools to learn faster  

Learning, experimenting, and sharing â€” thatâ€™s what keeps me moving ðŸš€
